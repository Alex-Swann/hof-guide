# hof-guide

This is a guide to the `hof` - Home Office Forms - project.

## What is hof?

hof is a collection of tools used for building GOV.UK themed, form-based workflows in a rapid, repeatable, and extensible manner. It aims to reduce simple forms as much as possible to being configuration-only.

It handles normalisation and validation of inputs, user journey flow control, and persistence of user input across a session.

## What *isn't* hof?

A complete, out-of-the-box, enterprise software solution. You will still need to write code for all but the simplest use cases.

## Using hof

If you're ready to try building your first hof form then carry on to our [development guide](./development/getting-started).
