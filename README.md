# hof-guide

This is a guide to the `hof` - Home Office Forms - project.

## What is hof?

hof is a collection of tools used for building form-based workflows in a rapid, repeatable, and extensible manner. It aims to reduce simple forms as much as possible to being configuration-only.

hof is written in node.js, and makes *heavy* use of [express](http://expressjs.com/). A familiarity with these two things will be invaluable for building projects in hof.

## What *isn't* hof?

A complete, out-of-the-box, enterprise software solution. You will still need to write code for all but the simplest use cases.

## Using hof

If you're ready to try building your first hof form then carry on to our [development guide](./development/getting-started).
